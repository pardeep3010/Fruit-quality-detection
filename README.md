# 🍎 Fruit Quality Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a machine learning-based solution that detects the **type of fruit** and classifies its **quality** into one of three categories: **Fresh**, **Mild**, or **Rotten**. It uses image processing and a convolutional neural network (CNN) built on **TensorFlow** and **MobileNetV2** to analyze fruit images and predict their quality in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects fruit type (e.g., Apple, Banana, Orange, etc.)
- Classifies fruit quality into:
  - Fresh
  - Mild
  - Rotten
- Trained on a custom dataset of fruit images
- User-friendly interface (optional: web app or GUI)
- High accuracy with MobileNetV2 backbone

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Pretrained **MobileNetV2** used for feature extraction
- Custom classification head for fruit quality categories
- Categorical cross-entropy loss with softmax output
- Image size: 224x224
- Trained using TensorFlow/Keras

## 📂 Dataset

- Custom dataset with labeled images of fruits
- Organized into subfolders by class:
  ```
  dataset/
  ├── Apple/
  │   ├── Fresh/
  │   ├── Mild/
  │   └── Rotten/
  ├── Banana/
  │   └── ...
  └── Orange/
      └── ...
  ```

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fruit-quality-detection.git
cd fruit-quality-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Usage

```bash
python predict.py --image path/to/fruit_image.jpg
```

Or run the web app (if implemented):

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📊 Results

| Class      | Accuracy |
|------------|----------|
| Fresh      | 95%      |
| Mild       | 92%      |
| Rotten     | 93%      |

> Confusion matrix and training graphs available in the `results/` folder.

## ✅ Future Work

- Real-time detection using camera input
- Integration with IoT devices for smart agriculture
- Expand dataset with more fruit types
